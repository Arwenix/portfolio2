story = "She was drowning herself with his memories. She remembered the day they started talking like casual friends, the day he proposed to her, her first ride with him on his  bike, their first day at the beach. She vividly remembered it, as if they were there yesterday. Holding hands, walking in silence and watching the waves run in between their feet, she had broken the silence saying, I want to be near you throughout my sandwich. He had looked at her lovingly, cuping her face gently between his hands and had said,  I will always be near you till my last breath."

instruction = '''
Welcome to the love story experiment! \n\n
In a moment, you will read a love story written by a hopeless romantic. 
You will read the story word by word, your task is then to press the ‘space’ key when you have read the word to measure how long it takes for you to read a word. 
Press the “space” key when you are ready to start the experiment...

goodbye = '''
The experiment is done. Thank you for your participation'''
